## [0.0.6] - SNAPSHOT
  ### Added
  - Added support for label and expression predicates

## [0.0.5]
  ### Added
  - Added Support for Event-B
  - Added Support for Reals in Classical-B
  - Added support for FREETYPES
  - Added working clj-kondo config
  ### Changed
  - Default state space (empty machine) is only loaded if needed (instead of on start-up).
  - Make `if` more similar to `let`: `if-expr` was replaced by `if` which works with both expressions and predicates
  - add support for n-ary tuples in `maplet`
  - add support for variadic version of `b=`
  ### Fixed
  - some nested operators were swallowed by the copy constructors (Java, BParser)

## [0.0.4]
  ### Added:
  - Added definitions
  - Added specs to ir2ast

  - Changed lisb representation of couple from vector to (|-> left right)/(maplet left right)
  - Changed ir of couple from vector to {:tag :maplet, :left left, :right right}
  - Changed application of to-vector for comprehension-set ids from ir2ast to lisb2ir

## [0.0.3]
  ### we somehow messed up versions numbers; sorry.
  ### compiling a list of changes are left as an exercise to the reader

## [0.0.2]
  ### Added
  - Added work in progress lisb api doc
  - Added machine-headers refinement, implementation, model and system.
  - Added translation of USES, EXTENDS, INCLUDES, SEES, PROMOTES substitutions.
  - Added translation of case and operation substitution
  - Added parameter support to machine-name.
  - Added multiple arguments for constraints, properties, invariants and init.
      Arguments for constraints, properties and invariants are chained via AConjunctPredicate.
      Arguments for init are chained via ASequenceSubstitution.
  - Added example sebastian with tests.
  - Added multi-arity for subset and strict-subset.
  - Added multi-arity for contains.
  - Added multi-arity subs for any, let-sub, var, precondition and assert.
  - Added cartesian-product and mul to lisb-dsl and ir.
  - Added lisb-dsl:
      {ids | pred} -> (bcomprehension-set ids pred)
      (sets :E :F #{:a :b}) -> (bsets (bdeferred-set :E) (benumerated-set :F :a :b))
